Why i make this project?
I have a problem. There are two projects that i should develop. I have a greater desire to develop one of the them, and the other is not much. So i decided to set aside time for two projects. I should to pay attention to the projects one by one in a certain order. But there is another problem: i can't control myself. I can bail on allocated time or order, so i decided to make worker service that will monitor the order. I don't know how far i will develop this project, but i hope that i'll at least make the code so clean that it won't make anyone's eyes bleed.
